# Introduction #

SharpTaconite is a learning project that showcases the use of fluent interfaces in API development while still creating a useful utility.

# Details #

The [jQuery Taconite plugin](http://malsup.com/jquery/taconite/#overview) is a wonderful utility designed to minimize the number of AJAX requests from client. Working in .net environments I found the need for a helper class that make creating Taconite XML command documents easier and error free.

# Todo #

This is still very much a work in progress. There are some jQuery actions that are still missing and keeping up with jQuery project will be ongoing. SharpTaconite might already be of some use so feel free to use and/or extend the class.
